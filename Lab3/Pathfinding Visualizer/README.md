# Pathfinding Visualizer

A web application to visualize pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra and A*.

## Features

- Interactive grid for setting start, end, walls, and weights
- Visualizes Dijkstra and A* algorithms
- Adjustable grid size and speed
- Paintbrush and fire trail effects

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamvel-eng/126-Lab_works.git
   ```
2. **Open the project folder in VS Code or your preferred editor.**
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser to run the app.**

## Usage

- Select a tool (start, end, wall, weight) and click or drag on the grid.
- Choose an algorithm and press "Run".
- Adjust grid size and speed as needed.
